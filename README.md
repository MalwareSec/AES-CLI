# AES with RSA key encryption toolkit
## Python AES Encryption and Decryption Program with Base64 Support

This is an encryption toolkit written in python that encrypts and decrypts files/strings (also supports string encryption/decryption for base64 encoded objects)

**Setup**

Create your key (RSA private key):

    python make_key.py

Your RSA private key is then stored in the file '*key.bin*'

Run the main encryption program:

    python encrypt.py

The main function encrypts and then decrypts the test.txt (just PoC) file located in the same directory. This is just one example of the functionalities this toolkit has, however the possibilities are endless with the functions provided. Enjoy
